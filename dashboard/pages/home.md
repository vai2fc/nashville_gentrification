# Forces of Gentrification: Nashville, 2000-2010

### Introduction
What does gentrification look like in Nashville, TN? How can we quantify the feeling that something is changing - and that not everybody is getting to benefit from the explosive growth of our city?

To build toward a more diverse and equitable city, it is incumbent upon Nashvillians to examine what 'gentrification' looks like from multiple perspectives. This project seeks to help residents visualize how Nashville's communities changed between 2000 and 2010, as well as examine some of the historical and natural forces that may have made certain communities more susceptible to gentrification and its associated displacement than others.

### How To Use This Dashboard
On the Maps tab, there are two maps of Davidson county, TN: on the left, a map from the 2000 US Census; on the right, a map from the 2010 US Census. Each map is divided by US Census tract for their respective years.

Both maps visualize areas that were susceptible to gentrification based on a tract's ratio of median income in comparison to overall county median income. The 2010 map also shows the intensity of gentrification that occurred over the preceding 10 years in each tract, based on changes in the ratio of each tract's average household income, share of white residents, share of college-educated residents, or median rent compared to the county as a whole. (For additional information on how these gentrification scores are calculated, see the Context and Credits tab above.)

By clicking on an individual census tract in either map, visitors may explore each pocket of Davidson county in more depth. The selectors at the left allow visitors to choose specific demographic stats to view at the tract level, as well as toggle on and off layers which show historical redlining (based on the 1935-1940 Home Owners' Loan Corporation maps) and natural disasters (tornadoes between 1990 and 2018).

### Questions To Get Started
I invite my fellow Nashvillians to explore the *Forces of Gentrification* dashboard for yourselves and offer two questions to get started:  

1. Do these quantitative measures of gentrification align with your perception of how the city changed between 2000 and 2010?  

2. Where might we focus our attention to ensure that we keep working toward a more diverse, livable, sustainable, and equitable future for all Nashvillians?
