# Forces of Gentrification: Nashville, 2000-2010

That many Nashville neighborhoods have gentrified - and continue to gentrify today - is a relatively uncontested statement. What gentrification means in Nashville, which communities have been most impacted by it, and what historical factors have shaped where and when gentrification has occurred, however, is not as clear.  
To build toward a more diverse and equitable city, it is incumbent upon Nashvillians to understand what 'gentrification' means, as well as the historical and natural forces that make parts of our community more susceptible to gentrification and the resulting displacement of marginalized peoples. This project seeks to visualize how the practice of 'redlining' neighborhoods in the 1930s as well as the reconstruction of the city after three natural disasters (the 1998 and 2008 Middle Tennessee tornadoes and 2010 Nashville flood) have shaped how Nashville's neighborhoods have changed between 2000 and 2010.
