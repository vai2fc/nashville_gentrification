### Code for this R Shiny App
The code for this application, as well as for the API calls and data cleaning, are available in [this GitHub Repo](https://github.com/vai2fc/nashville_gentrification).

### Data Sources
The data for the *Forces of Gentrification: Nashville, 2000-2010* project were collected from the following sources:
* 2000 demographic data were retrieved from the US Census Bureau's [Decennial Census, Summary File 3 API](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2000/dec/summary-file-3.html)
* 2010 demographic data were retrieved from the US Census Bureau's [5-year American Community Survey API](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year/2010.html)
* Tornado data were downloaded from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data repository on [Oasis Hub](https://oasishub.co/dataset/usa-tornado-historical-tracks-noaa)
* The georectified 1935-1940 HOLC map of Nashville's neighborhoods was downloaded from the University of Richmond Digital Scholarship Lab's [Mapping Inequality](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=11/36.053/-86.8&city=nashville-tn&text=downloads) project website

### Personal Acknowledgements
Last but not least, thank you to my amazing colleagues and instructors in the Data Science 4 cohort at Nashville Software School for their patience, good humor, and bug-squashing expertise. Thanks are owed to my long-suffering partner, too, for commiserating about data cleaning all while offering constructive feedback on the project. Any remaining bugs, errors, and questionable design choices are my own.
