# Context and Caveats

### Background
When I first set out to explore and visualize patterns of gentrification in Nashville, TN, I came across a 2018 paper by Rachel Bogardus Drew entitled "[Gentrification: Framing Our Perceptions](https://www.enterprisecommunity.org/resources/gentrification-framing-our-perceptions-7602)." Drew's paper helped orient me to the history and historiography of gentrification and drew my attention to the diversity of perspectives on what constitutes gentrification in the modern American city.

The [Mapping Inequality](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=5/39.542/-94.58) project, led by Robert K. Nelson of the University of Richmond Digital Scholarship Lab, was also helpful for gaining an historical perspective on government-sponsored red-lining of US neighborhoods in the 1930s. Having previously tried my hand at georectifying historical maps, I can say with confidence that there are simply not enough accolades for the work the team did to create high-quality, open-access shapefiles out of dozens of historic maps. The team's work sets the stage for the chilling story of just how deeply-rooted and *systemic* racial bias and inequities are in the US - and it seems that [their work has just begun](https://dsl.richmond.edu/socialvulnerability/).

Finally, this project is borne as much from a desire to look forward as it is to look back. The morning after the [March 2-3, 2020 tornadoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_outbreak_of_March_2%E2%80%933,_2020) swept through middle Tennessee, I walked through my neighborhood and was overwhelmed by the sheer breadth and depth of destruction wrought on so many communities in a single night. I began to wonder what would happen to all of the people displaced by the tornadoes - and who would *be able to* return and rebuild. Richard Florida's 2019 write-up of [recent research on how Hurricane Katrina drove widespread gentrification and displacement of black residents in New Orleans](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-12/new-orleans-gentrification-tied-to-hurricane-katrina) was a particularly influential piece in my early research on the topic of gentrification in Nashville.

### Methods

The quantitative definition of gentrification applied in the *Forces of Gentrification: Nashville, 2000-2010* project is a hybrid of two widely-recognized scholarly definitions. The first comes from [Bostic & Martin's 2003 paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1080/0042098032000136147) in which they examine gentrification across 50 US metropolitan areas' between 1970 and 2000. The second comes from [Ellen & Ding's 2016](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/periodicals/cityscpe/vol18num3/guest.pdf) assessment of gentrification in major metropolitan areas between 1980 and 2010. The current project's hybrid approach was driven, in part, by the availability of open-source data, but also by a desire to define clear heuristics of gentrification that can be explored independently on this dashboard.

To identify areas that are susceptible to gentrification, I apply Bostic & Martin's (2003) definition: any tract whose median income is less than 50% of the metropolitan area's median income is considered at risk. In 2000, approximately XX% of Nashville's census tracts would have been considered susceptible to gentrification based on this criterion.

To identify areas that have been gentrified, I apply Ellen and Ding's (2016) definition: a tract is considered gentrified if it sees a 10+ percentage point increase in tract-to-county ratio of average household income, share of white residents, share of college-educated residents, or median rent. Given that Ellen and Ding suggest that gentrification can be quantified by any one of these four metrics, I have added a "strength of gentrification" indicator to the data on this dashboard to illustrate how many of these four gentrification indicators have changed by 10+ percentage points in relation to the county average between 2000 and 2010.

### Caveats
There are a [multitude of ways to define 'gentrification'](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7241805/). Taking a quantitative approach based on US Census data, and utilizing the methods outlined above to identify susceptible and gentrified tracts, offers a snapshot of how Nashville's community changed between 2000 and 2010. This app, however, only provides a handful of lenses through which we can think about how Nashville has changed - and will continue to change in the coming decades. As we inflect our demographic data with [more nuanced understandings of racial and ethnic identities](https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-census-middle-east-north-africa-race/) and enrich our knowledge about the impact of [anti-displacement policies on other cities](https://www.urbandisplacement.org/policy-case-studies) around the world, how we define gentrification should continue to evolve.  

I would encourage visitors to take the 'gentrification scores' presented here as a starting point for thinking about what we know about our communities and what additional data or information (quantitative *and* qualitative) we should examine to develop the right policies to build a more diverse, equitable future for the city of Nashville.
